🧪 API Sandbox – React Practice Ground

A frontend testing environment for playing with APIs, routing, loading states, and UI components. Built with React, Axios, and Router DOM for practicing real-world frontend workflows — and surviving bootcamp nonsense one page at a time.
🚀 Features

    🔍 Search by User ID – Pull posts from JSONPlaceholder API using a user-provided ID.

    🌀 Skeleton Loading State – Smooth UI while waiting for data to load.

    🔁 Routing – Dynamic navigation with React Router and back button logic.

    🎯 Input & Navigation Logic – Controlled search input, Enter key triggers, and programmatic routing.

🧠 Why This Exists

To level up core React fundamentals through hands-on reps — including routing, API calls, and loading states — without relying on libraries like shadcn or Tailwind. Built as a controlled sandbox to actually understand what’s happening under the hood before stacking on fancy tools.
